# INFT-22000-Final-Project

This is a simple chatbot where you can ask it 'hi, how are you, what is your name, and bye'.

The reason for the simplicity is due to the fact that training it on any larger dataset would render the chatbot unusuable as I did not have the time to train the model on a larger dataset.
